=================

The **tidy\_data.txt** file in the repo contains the average of each
variable for each activity and each subject in the last column. The file
binds the **train** and the **test** data collected by the **Human
Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset** which is explained in
the **Experiments**.

The **tidy\_data.txt** file is the result from:

-   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

-   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.

-   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set

-   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

-   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.

Each step of the process is commented in the **run\_analysis.R** script
in the repo.
